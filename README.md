# Portfolio
## **Hi, I'm Mateusz 👋** 
I have a master's degree in public administration, which I gained at Jagiellonian University in Krakow. I've spent the last 6 years in the United Kingdom where I worked tremendously hard to obtain my own place to live for me and my family. After fulfilling this goal I wanted to get myself a job in which I will be doing what I really like, so I decided to become a Software Tester. I'm an extremely inquisitive person, a go-getter with a massive drive to learn and achieve my goals. 🙋‍♀️
My goal is to develop testing knowledge and skills and someday become an automation tester. On this site, I would like to share all my paths of learning skills needed to reach my goal.
🎯 I invite you to my portfolio, which I created here, as a part of a new challenge. Here you can find the new abilities I gained from personal studies, research, and courses I took part in. 

- I’m currently working on my own automation project 🛠️
- I’m currently learning JAVA language :wrench:
- I’m a possessor of an ISTQB certificate :notebook:
- Ask me about cars, F1, simracing, investing, and politics...  - they are some of my hobbies 🌿
- How to reach me: ceniuk.mateusz@gmail.com:mailbox_closed:
